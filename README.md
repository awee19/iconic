iconic foundry
======

Description
======
I created the iconic foundry as a website to house my various design portfolio. These design works include icon, website and other graphic designs. The design ideation and inspiration can be found in individual page. 

Although the iconic foundry is a front end project currently, I plan to integrate some back end integration in the near future. This will be largely done using Node.JS. I have also plan to create two more responsive break points (tablet and phone) after I have finalised with the desktop version.
