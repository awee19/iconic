The Iconic Icon Foundry (c) 2014.

A pet project by Ting Yi Wei.

The Iconic Icon Foundry is a online portfolio which showcase the various collections of icons created by me.
The website aims to be lightweight by reducing the dependency on Javascript.
Transitions and animations are mainly written in CSS in order to optimise the performance.
The main reason for this is to improve the experience of the website on mobile devices.
Drop shadows and rounded corners are also reduced to improve support for older web browsers.
