        <h2>The iconic foundry</h2>
        <p>
            The iconic foundry started out as a project when I was looking for a place where I can upload my icons. My
            initial plan was to upload my works onto <a href="http://www.dribbble.com" target="_blank">dribbble</a>.
            Unfortunately, I realised I can’t. I therefore decide to create a website where I can showcase all my works.
            After much consideration, I decide to use the iconic foundry as a base for my design works.
        </p>

        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
            Over the course of the past 10 years, I have done numerous part time jobs and internships during my school
            vacations. One thing which I came to realise after all the working experience I have acquired over the last
            decade was that I enjoyed servicing people. Nothing makes my day better than seeing the smile from a
            satisfied customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was introduced to user experience (UX) design in the third year of my study in the
            National University of Singapore. I was really psyched after attending the module as I realised that I have
            the potential to improve the users’ lives and experience as a UX designer.  This is when I make up my mind
            to be a UX designer after completing my bachelor degree in Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Communications
            and Media.
        </p>
        <p>
            My philosophy as an aspiring UX designer is to be a designer with a heart. I believe that the
            only way which you can empathise your users is to truly care for them. This allows you to see things in
            their perspectives and truly understand their needs.  I also believe that UX is the art of balancing the
            needs of the users with the requirements of the business plan.
        </p>

        <h2>Current interest</h2>
        <p>
            My current interest is to design a set of icons which is semantic to older adults (50 and above). This came
            about after I observed that my mother was not able to identify the search box of a video streaming
            application when she was trying to search for the video she which wanted to watch on her tablet. From this
            experience, I realised that there is a flaw in icon design as they, no pun intended, might not be iconic
            enough for older adults.
